     Method Binding:
     --------------------
      -replaceing method call with its appropriate reference is called binding
    There are two types of binding
    a)static binding:
      ------------------
       -if binding process has been done at the time of compilation then it is called as static binding
     b)Dynamic binding:
       ----------------------
       -if binding process has been done at the time of runing application then it is called dynamic binding
   -having diiferent forms to the same method is called as polymorphism.due to polymorphism we can perform different functionality with same call
     there two types of polymorphism
      1)static polymorphism:
          ------------------------
                -if polymorphism is implemented by using static binding then it is called as static polymorphism.in apex we can implement static polymorphism by using method overloading
     2)Dynamic polymorphism:
         -----------------------------
                -if polymorphism is implemented by using dynamic binding then it is called as dynamic polymorphism.in apex language it can be implemented by using method overriding
MethodOverloading:
-------------------------
    -defining number of methods with same name and with different signature is called as method overloading.
       -signature of method is nothing but number of parameters and their datatypes but not return type
         -mehod overloading can be with any type of method
        -it is possible with in same class or subclass also
        public class MyMathClass
         {
          public static Integer add(integer a,integer b)
                {
                    return a+b;
                }
          public static Integer add(Integer a,Integer b,Integer c)
                {
                   return a+b+c;
                }
          public static Decimal add(decimal a,integer b)
                {
                    return a+b;
                }
          public static void add(Integer a,Integer b)
               {
               }
         }
Method Overriding:
------------------------
     -defining number of methods with same name and with same signature is called as method overriding
     -only virtual and abstract methods can be overrided
     -it is possible with in subclasses
    -we need to use override keyword to override method
   virtual method:
   ------------------
         -method can be declared as virtual by using virtual keyword
         -virtual method must have body
        -it can be defined either virtual or abstract class
        -it can be overrided in its subclasses
